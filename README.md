# Internship Report ‚Äì Arc Autos (M) Sdn. Bhd.

This repository documents my 10-week industrial training at **Arc Autos (M) Sdn. Bhd.**, Durian Tunggal, Melaka (July ‚Äì September 2024). The internship provided practical exposure to CNC machining, automotive component production, and real-world manufacturing processes.

## Overview of Training
Key areas of involvement:
- **CNC Machining & Maintenance**  
  - Operated 4 CNC milling machines: Fanuc Robodrill, Mitsubishi M-V5CN, Awea HF-1000, Tida MV-800  
  - Manufactured motorcycle parts, exhaust flanges, intake manifold inlets, and custom components  
  - Performed maintenance tasks: coolant mixing/refilling, SW-68 oil refuelling, tool changing, and carbide insert replacement  

- **Design & Software**  
  - Created 3D models and sketches in **SolidWorks 2024** (e.g., panel switch bracket for Toyota GR 86)  
  - Generated toolpaths in **Mastercam X9**, optimizing machining instructions for CNC operations  
  - Used **EZCAD3** for precision laser marking (engraved ‚ÄúTONNKA‚Äù branding and thread codes on 110 custom hex screw nuts)  

- **Manufacturing Processes**  
  - Cutting of aluminium and iron materials using circular saws and band saws  
  - Surface finishing via grinding and polishing (improved clarity for laser engraving)  
  - Manual and pneumatic thread tapping (corrected customer complaint by manually reworking 600 components)  

- **Special Projects**  
  - Reassembled a **Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution 5** from frame to fully functional condition  
  - Tasks included sanding, primer coating, frame filler application, full-body painting, cleaning engine components, fitting doors/hood/bumper/spoiler, installing lighting/electrical systems, dashboard assembly, and final alignment  

- **Additional Exposure**  
  - Operated conventional lathe and vertical milling machines for bonnet pins and monoshock brackets  
  - Learned importance of SOPs, safety protocols, and teamwork in a real manufacturing environment  

## Key Outcomes
- Produced **200+ precision machined components** for automotive use  
- Improved machining efficiency by **15%** through optimized setups  
- Reduced CNC setup time by **10%** via improved toolpath programming  
- Completed **manual correction of 600 defective components** to meet customer requirements  
- Successfully reassembled a **Mitsubishi Evo 5** into a fully functional vehicle in ~2 weeks  
- Strengthened technical, problem-solving, and project management skills in manufacturing engineering
